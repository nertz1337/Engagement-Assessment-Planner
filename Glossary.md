# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines key terms used in the context of offensive security assessments.

---

-   **Adversary Simulation:** A security exercise where a team emulates the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of a real-world threat actor to test a network's defenses. A core component of a Red Team engagement.

-   **Blue Team:** The team responsible for defending an organization's network and systems from attack. They manage security tools, monitor for threats, and lead incident response.

-   **Command and Control (C2/C&C):** The server infrastructure used by an attacker (or Red Team) to communicate with and control compromised systems within a target network.

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attack designed to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by overwhelming it with traffic or requests.

-   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** A category of security tools that monitor endpoint devices (laptops, servers) to detect suspicious activity and provide response capabilities.

-   **Exploit:** A piece of code, a command, or a technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability in a system to cause unintended behavior, such as gaining unauthorized access.

-   **Flag:** A pre-defined objective in a Red Team engagement. "Capturing the flag" signifies the successful achievement of a goal (e.g., gaining Domain Admin rights).

-   **Lateral Movement:** The techniques an attacker uses to move from a compromised system to other machines within the same network.

-   **MITRE ATT&CKÂ®:** A globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It's used to classify and describe attacker behaviors.

-   **Penetration Test (Pentest):** A time-boxed security assessment of a specific application or network to find and document as many vulnerabilities as possible.

-   **Phishing:** A type of social engineering attack where an attacker sends fraudulent emails purporting to be from a reputable source to induce individuals to reveal personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.

-   **Purple Team:** A collaborative exercise where the Red Team and Blue Team work together. The Red Team executes an attack, and the Blue Team works to detect and respond, with open communication between them to improve security controls in real-time.

-   **Red Team:** The team that plays the role of the attacker in an engagement. They test an organization's defenses by simulating the actions of a real-world adversary.

-   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** A set of tools and services that provides a holistic view of an organization's information security by combining security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM).

-   **Social Engineering:** The psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.

-   **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):** A description of the behavior of a threat actor. Tactics are the high-level goals, techniques are how those goals are achieved, and procedures are the specific implementations of those techniques.

-   **Vulnerability:** A weakness or flaw in a system, process, or control that can be exploited by a threat actor.

-   **White Cell:** In a Red Team engagement, the small group of stakeholders within the client organization who are aware of the exercise and act as the primary point of contact for the Red Team.
